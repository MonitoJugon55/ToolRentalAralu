<h1>Description and why i made it</h1>
First useful project it is a tool rental desktop app, it was made using C#, .NET 6 and FireSharp (Firebase).

My sister started a rental project with some tools she had, so i made this app for her to manage de data of every rented tool.
<h3>Extra</h3>
It's pretty simple but it is the first time i made a desktop app that is used by normal users.

<h3>Important</h3>
Every comment will be really appreciated.

PD: The whole code is in spanish, sorry.
